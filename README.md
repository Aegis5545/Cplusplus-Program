CS-210 SNHU Project 3
What this project does
What I did was create an app that sorts through a text file that has various strings within a text file. This text file is something that would be used in something like a grocery stores inventory system, or online ordering. When you asked it to read through a list with a keyword provided by the user, it counted the amount of times said keyword popped up in the text file, and stored said data with the keyword provided by the user, and the number of times it popped up. Multiple values could be stored. Then, the user can convert that data into a histogram, where the keyword was still there, but instead of numbers, it turned into a histogram. Then, when the file was closed, it created a .dat file with all the data from the histogram on it and outputted it into the project folder.

What I did particularly well was how simple the program was. There wasn't a huge amount of added stuff, like unneeded text, long code that could cause problems if changed, instead I created something simple yet effecient, and something the end user can understand and follow.

That being said, my code might be a bit annoying to add things on to, with how simple it is if you wanted a more complex program you might need to add more things to it and re-write code to better suite a more complex program, and how the code I created would interact with other properties of a more complex program.

I'd say the most challenging part of creating my program was going through and reading the file, and adding values to the keywords. It took me a lot of research throughout zybooks to remember how to code .compare functions, and compare variables with one another, it took my a good hour or so of trying to remember where I could fine that. That being said, I also used W3Schools to help me better understand the compare property and was a big help for me to better understand what goes where, and what affects what in my code.

I learned a lot about comparing variables, and how to work with different file formats, these skills will be very useful later down the line when I'm working with all sorts of coding problems and files.

I made this project managable and readable by making it quite simple and easy to follow. Sure, there's no fancy parts of my code and program, but I don't think it really needs to be. I feel like adding more flashy things would create problems later down the road, especially for a program that has a simple task.
